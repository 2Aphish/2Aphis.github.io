<h1>3D Printer Fixes - Z-Offset</h1>

<p>Sometimes 3D printers need slight adjustments to work at their absolut best. Working with a Luzbot Mini this weekend I noticed skirt of the print was a little squished. For those who aren't familar with 3D printing the skirt is the line drawn around the 3D printing area that helps establish the fillament flow. the skirt also allows you to assess the settings before launching into the actual print (i.e. if the head isn't extruding or if an offset is wrong). In this case, the squished skirt indicated that the Z-Offset needed some adjustment.</p>
<p>In the long run, this is a minor setting set-back as it does not affect other aspects of the 3D print beyond the first layer; the bottom of your print will just have a little lip. With that said I have never calibrated the Z-Offset on a Luzbot Mini 3D printer before and thought it would be a great opportunity to learn.</p>
